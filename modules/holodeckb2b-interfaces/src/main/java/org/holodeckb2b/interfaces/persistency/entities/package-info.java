/**
 * Contains the interface definitions of the "<i>entity objects</i>" used by the Holodeck B2B Core to store information
 * on a message unit to the database. They are an abstraction from, or proxy to, the actual stored object so the
 * persistency provider can easily reload objects from storage without impacting the entity object reference as used by
 * the Core.
 * <p>The entity objects implement the generic message model and also extend the generic message model interfaces. Note
 * that even as they are used to store data there are no <i>setter</i> methods defined in the entity objects. This is
 * because changes to a stored meta-data must be performed through the data access objects so they can manage (and
 * optimize) them.

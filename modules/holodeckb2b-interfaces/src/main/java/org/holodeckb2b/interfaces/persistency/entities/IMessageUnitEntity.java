/**
 * Defines the interface of the persistent entity object that is used by the Holodeck B2B to store the general message
 * unit meta-data.
 * <p>It is based on the {@link IMessageUnit} interface from the message model. It however does not include
 * <i>setter</i> methods as changes need to be done through the DAO objects. This to ensure that changes in the
 * meta-data of the message unit are saved correctly.
 * <p>As persistency implementations may optimize the loading of collections it is not required to load collection
 * valued fields immediately but perform <i>lazy loading</i>. Therefore this interface adds the
 * {@link #isLoadedCompletely()} method to the getter methods already defined in the {@link IMessageUnit} interface
 * which indicates whether all information is loaded from storage. If a getter method is used for a field that has not
 * been loaded a {@link PersistenceException} will be thrown.<br>
 * Lazy loading SHOULD ONLY be used by persistency implementations when multiple entity objects are retrieved from
 * storage and it is not clear if all meta-data will be used in further processing.
 * <p>In case of the general meta-data that applies to all message units only the list of processing states may be
 * lazily loaded, i.e. {@link #getProcessingStates()} should only be called when the data is completely loaded. <b>
 * NOTE</b> that implementations MUST return the current processing state even if the object is not completely loaded.

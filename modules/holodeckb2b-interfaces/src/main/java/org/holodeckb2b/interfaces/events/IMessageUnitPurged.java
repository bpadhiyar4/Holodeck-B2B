/**
 * Is the <i>message processing event</i> that indicates that a message unit is deleted from the Holodeck B2B Core
 * message database because the period for maintaining it's meta-data has expired.
 * <p>Note that the <i>"purge"</i> {@link IWorkerTask} implementation is responsible for triggering this event and it
 * therefore depends on this implementation when this event is exactly triggered. An implementation can for example only
 * trigger the event for <i>User Message</i> message units and also decide not to include the payload data.
 * <p>This event must be considered to be the last opportunity for extension to process a message unit. After the event
 * is handled all meta-data, and for User Messages payload data is removed from the system. But note that these data can
 * still be included in back-ups of database and/or file system. It is up to the operator of the system to removed these
 * if needed.

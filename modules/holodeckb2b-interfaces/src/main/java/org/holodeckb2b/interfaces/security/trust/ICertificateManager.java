/**
 * Defines the interface of the Holodeck B2B <i>Certificate Manager</i> component which is responsible for providing the 
 * private keys and X509v3 certificates to the components processing the messages and validating trust in certificates.
 * <p>The interface distinguishes between the key pairs used by Holodeck B2B for signing and decryption and certificates 
 * of trading partners used for encryption and identification.  
 * The key pairs consist of the private key and at least the certificate containing the corresponding public key. 
 * Sometimes however when signing a message the signature needs to include a certificate chain up to a common trusted 
 * root. Therefore key pairs can contain the such a chain. Trading partner certificates relate directly to the trading 
 * partner and contain its public key which should be used for encryption.<br>
 * All key pairs and trading partner certificates must have a unique "alias" that can be used in the security 
 * configuration section of the P-Mode. How key pairs and partner certificates are registered with the Certificate 
 * Manager is not defined by this interface and left up to the implementation. 
 * <p>How the validation of trust in a certificate (path) is established is implementation dependent and therefore the 
 * only defined methods are to validate the trust. Two versions of the validation method are defined, one for generic 
 * validation of trust according to the Certificate Manager's trust policy and one that uses additional configuration
 * that applies to the signature for which the certificate (path) was used. The implementation of the latter is optional
 * and whether it is supported can be checked using the {@link #supportsConfigBasedValidation()} method.
 * <p>There can always be just one <i>Certificate Manager</i> active in an Holodeck B2B instance. The implementation to
 * use is loaded using the Java <i>Service Prover Interface</i> mechanism.  
 * 
 * @author Sander Fieten (sander at holodeck-b2b.org)
 * @since 5.0.0 A <i>Certificate Manager</i> already existed in version 4.x as part of the <i>Security 
 * 		Provider</i>. Its functionality however is more generic and therefore it has been decoupled and split off into 
 * 		a stand alone component. As trust validation and management have been left to the implementation the related 
 * 		methods from the 4.x version have been removed.
